# Beyond-Borders
The "Mapping Migration" study analyzes migration patterns in West Bengal, highlighting that female migration is primarily driven by marriage, while male migration is economically motivated. COVID-19 led to mass reverse migration due to job loss, poor living conditions, and inadequate government support. Remittances, especially internal, significantly contribute to district-level economic strength, with Midnapore and Nadia being key recipients. The study finds a positive correlation between urbanization, GDSP, and in-migration rates. Policy failures, including inaccurate migrant data and lack of coordination between state and central governments, hindered welfare support. Recommendations include worker registration, regional planning, tourism promotion, and establishing social safety nets.
